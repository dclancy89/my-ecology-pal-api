## Description

This is a POC (Proof of Concept) NestJS based backend API to support the My Ecology Pal app. This backend is for storing and retrieving data for the app user.

This app is not intended to be used as a production ready app, nor is it intended to be used for live field data where data integrity is needed.

## My Ecology Pal API

This API supports the saving and retrieving of data collected from the My Ecology Pal Android App. In this POC, users are required to have a valid API key in order to GET or POST data to this API.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

```
